    "## Probabilistic Context Free Grammars as a Data Augmentation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed in the \"Supervised Simple Classifier Ablation and Parameter Sweep\" notebook that the classification task can reach up to 85% accuracy when given ideal hyperparameters. However, the supervised classification task performed on that notebook was heavily dependent on labeled student data, which is limited and has a high human cost. In attempting to address this issue, we study the use of probabilistic context free grammars to increase the size and diversity of our training dataset. Given a small set of human-labeled student data, we encode semantically equivalent syntactic variations of code, maintaining the overall structure. \n",
